I predicted that the Deep Learning model would have the highest accuracy because it used more than one layer of hidden nodes. The SVM and Logistic Regression models had around the same accuracy (0.87) once they were hypertuned with the GridSearch parameters. The Deep Learning model had a slightly higher accuracy, (0.89). The scores of the hypertuned GridSearch models slightly increased when compared to the test scores of the regular SVM and Logistic Regression models. Overall, the Deep Learning model seemed to be the most accurate.
